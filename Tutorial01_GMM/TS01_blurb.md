# Machine Learning: Clustering and Density Estimation via Gaussian Mixtures

**Interested in Machine Learning?**

**Don't know where to start?**

**Never fear!** This Tuesday, we'll continue our discussion of clustering. Last
Tuesday, we invented and used K-Means to automatically identify flower species.
Today, we'll take a look at K-Means' next of kin: Gaussian Mixtures. A small but
important tweak will enable us to cluster datasets far beyond the power of K-Means!
Time permitting, we'll further vary the themes of doubt, iteration, and similarity
to understand and apply several related unsupervised learning algorithms.

By the end of our session, you'll:
 * Appreciate the utility of *doubt* in an algorithm, hence entering the Cult of Bayes.
 * Understand multiple clustering algorithms, and when to use which.
 * Enthuse to participate in more of MSAIL's activities!

## FAQ
 **What if I missed last week?** Answer: *come anyway*! We're still on the topic
 of clustering, so now's the perfect time to catch up. In fact, this week's
 algorithm is secretly the same as last time's, except for a small but important tweak!
